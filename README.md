# HIIR

#This is NOT usable currently.  I will edit this out once it is ready.

A header-only version of the [HIIR library by Laurent De Soras](http://ldesoras.free.fr/prod.html#src_hiir), updated to version 1.4.0.

This repo is the same as the original library, except with the contents of one source file moved into a header file to make the library header-only, and with the test folder removed.

For usage instructions, see the original library README file in `readme.txt`.
