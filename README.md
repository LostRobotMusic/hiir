# HIIR

A header-only version of the [HIIR library by Laurent De Soras](http://ldesoras.free.fr/prod.html#src_hiir), updated to version 1.40.

This repo is the same as the original library, except with the contents of one source file moved into a header file (and set as inline) to make the library header-only, and with the test folder removed.

For usage instructions, see the original library README file in `readme.txt`.
